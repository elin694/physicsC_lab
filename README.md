We drew out equipotential lines at each of 1V, 2V, 3V, 4V, 5V, and 6V from our voltage map. The first thing that we noticed that our regions with the lowest electric potential was concentrated towards a small circle-shaped (of voltage 0.8V to 1.03V) rather than a line. This hinted at the location of our negative electrodes, and that we have likely have a "point charge" for our negative electrode rather than a plate. This meant that we have a For our positive terminals we thought there was a region of almost constant charge (from 4.7V at one corner to 5V at another), so there could have been a Faraday Cage present, as in a faraday cage the charge is constant inside the cage. However, we looked at the electric field lines we drew, and noticed that a good portion of them originated from one electrode to the other in a way that Wass reminiscent of a dipole formation. The field vectors curved towards the negative terminal and looked like they intersected at a point, and there wasn't enough parallel electric field vectors that originated for the positive electrode to be a plate. Finally, we concluded that while there was a region of a similar voltage on the chart, if it was a Faraday cage, there would be a steeper gradient on the electric potential outside the cage, and the transition between the inside of the cage to the edge would be sharper, and there would be a net 0 charge inside the cage.
